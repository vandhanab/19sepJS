    <h2>Data Types</h2>
    <h4>Data types are divided into two types</h4>
    1.Primitive data types<br>
    2.Non-Primitive data type<br>
    <h3>Primitive data type :</h3>
    <ul>
     <li> Primitive data types are the fundamental building blocks used to represent single values.</li>
     <li>Primitive data type are directly stored in memory & are immutable.</li>
    <b>They are:</b>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Numbers:</b>The Numbers represents numeric values,including integers & floating-points Numbers. </li>
        <li><b>String:</b>It represents textual data,enclosed in single or double quotes.</li>
        <li><b>Boolean:</b>It represents a logical value,True or False.</li>
        <li><b>Null:</b>It represents an intentional  absence of any object value.</li>
        <li><b>Undefined:</b>It represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Non-Primitive data type</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-Primitive data types are Mutable, 
            Meaning there values can be changed after they are created,
             and they are stored and accessed by reference rather than by value.</li>
             <b>They are:</b>
             <ol>
                <li><b>Object:</b> It represents a collection of key-value pairs,
                    where keys are strings & values can be any data types , including other objects.</li>
                <li><b>Array:</b>It represents an orders collection of elements,accessed by index,starting from zero.</li>
             </ol>
    </ul>
